# rosvr

This repository contains a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image containing the environment needed to compile the relativ-osvr-plugin and the OSVR server on Linux.

It's name is rosvr because it's the short name for Relativ-OSVR and it's funky.

## Running rosvr

You must have both Docker and docker-compose installed on your system, then it's simple as that:
> docker-compose up

The image takes a while to build. You can have a couple of coffee breaks before it ends.
